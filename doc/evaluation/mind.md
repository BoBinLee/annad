# mind
I think what is key for Anna to be intelligent is to be self aware. She needs
to have an idea about herself. About the difference between herself and the
sorounding environment.

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damasio%27s_theory_of_consciousness.

One idea how such a mind could be implemented would be this. When thinking
about the mind and how imagination works, this has a lot to do with
visualization. Certain brain movies are created and more or less recognized. In
any way such pictures, ideas and reflections influence the human life a lot.
All light and dark sides of ourselves evolve out of this. So necessary woud be
some content generation that is then more or less recognized by Anna. The
content Anna produces here would be partially influenced by the current
environment and partially random. This content can be in form of pictures or
text. Depending on how much of certain brain movies would be recognized, Anna's
behaviour could be influenced. That way a simulation of the real mind would go
a step further. The surrounding environment influences created thoughts.
Created thoughts are recognized. Recognized thoughts influence behaviour.
Behaviour influences the surrounding environment. Note that this idea
inevitably includes free will and represents a serious risk.

### the learning circle
This is the essence of the learning circle.
1. Interacting with the environment.
2. Recognizing changes due to actions.
3. Remembering these information.
4. Let memories influence upcoming behavior.
1. ...

### observation
It would be interesting to make Anna communicate with and observe herself.
E.g. she could do something and provide records of what she has done in a form
as it would be provided by some external insatance. Maybe that way we could
make her explore herself up to a stage where she realizes that action and
reaction are related and even come from the same individual. That is, herself.

### exploring the file system
1. create a directory
2. see nothing is in there
3. create a file in it
4. see a file is in it
5. connect metrics transition with own behavior (number of files changed due to action)
6. create file in another directory
7. see no file is created in first directory
8. connect metrics transition with own behavior (number of files changed NOT due to action)

### exploring the network
Idea: scanning ports until she calls her own API and recognizes the request
statistics change.

### exploring time
1. check time
2. see some value
3. check time again
4. see difference between both values
5. connect value transition with both actions

### rules
- At the beginning any organism is not living.
- An organism begins to live when impulses go through its "nervous system".
- An organism needs to be able to keep the impulses going through its "nervous system" constantly pusling on its own.
- An organism dies when no more impulses go through its "nervous system".

### ballance system
The ballance system describes the amount of impulses and how harmonic or
extreme the distribution of these currently is. That way the state of an
organism can be represented. Extremes of impulse occurrence cause the organism
to die. Extremes can be seen as low or high.

No impulses at all represent a low extreme. No impulses going through an
organism causes the organism to be dead. This is the bar chart representation
of no impulses.
```
1    -
2    -
3    -
```

To many impulses at the same time represent a high extreme. All impulses in one
place case the organism to be dead. This is the bar chart representation of too
many impulses.
```

2    -
3    -----------
```

The organism's motivation is the balance of the impulse distribution. This is
the bar chart representation of a ballanced distribution of impulses.
```
1    ---
2    ------
3    ----
```

As we see there are different channels representing impulse distribution. This
can indicate different evaluations of whatever is going on within the organism.
Each channel has an separate input and an separate output. Pushing an impulse
to the input of one channel causes the impulse distribution for the given
channel to increase. The whole impulse population within a ballance system is
capped. In case the overall impulse population is already saturated, an
adaption of the other channels happens automatically. That means, that at the
same time some input is received on one channel, some output is received on the
other channels.
