### CLG, Complex Logic Gate
CLG, Complex logic gate, implements BB, Basic Behavior, when receiving input in
form of BI, Basic Inormation. Neurons should represent an implementation of
CLGs. Basic behavior is created when some sort of complex logic operation is
processed with respect to some fundamental input. In computer science there are
logic gates implementing logic operations causing some action. The concept of
CLGs presumes the need of more sophisticated logic gates to mimic human
behavior. The theory is that as soon as there are enough sufficient CLGs
intellectual explosion will happen. CLGs are supposed to be the minimal and
fundamental inborn logic units that can be used out of the box. This builtin
functionality should be the only hard coded logic. All other behavior must
result out of the combination of learned data, CLGs and neural connections.

### BI, Basic Information
BI, Basic Information, represent fundamental information that must be known to
reach a higher level of intelligence. The most fundamental BIs like numbers
from the decimal number system or letters from the latin alphabet simply need
to be provided. A human and a machine respectively cannot think of something
totally unknown out of nothing. There needs to be information in the first
place some kind of intelligence can collect and connect to generate new
knowledge. Looking at the process of how humans learn, we have teachers and
other humans who explain fundamentel concepts that help to explore the world by
our own. Having that said there is a need for some guidance for a machine to
learn.

### BB, Basic Behavior
BB, Basic Behavior, can probably be seen as instinct, intuition or talent.
There are presets within humans. These enable us to do things without actively
thinking about them. These things are might in our DNA, subconscious mind or as
football trainers would point at it, in our blood. BB lets us breathe from the
first second of our life, makes us fear dangerous things and lets us explore
our environment using our inborn senses. So some sort of BB a machine needs to
have to learn guided and later autonomous.
