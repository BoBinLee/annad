# annactl
The client implementation of Anna's network API is reprsented by the command
line tool `annactl`. This is what you can do with it.

- [log control](logging.md#log-control): configure Anna's logging behavior at runtime.
- [text interface](gateway.md#text-interface): feed Anna with text input.

Compile the client and check the help usage for more information.

```
make client
