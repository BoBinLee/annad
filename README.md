# anna
Anna, Artificial Neural Network Aspiration, aims to be self-learning and
self-improving software.

# overview

> AI is the last invention humanity will ever need to make

The project is at its very beginning. So don't expect too much. For quite a
while now I am thinking about machine learning and AI. This field is
fascinating and challenging in so many different ways. I want to use this
project as playground to improve knowledge by solving problems.

In fact the aim is to implement something living. Something that learns and
develops by itself. Something that solves the problems we are not capable of.
This ambitious dream should drive this project. Wether it is driven by me, or
somebody else, or some group of people way smarter than me. Live will find a way.
